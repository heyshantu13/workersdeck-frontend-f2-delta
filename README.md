# Technology Stack

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux.js.org/)
- [MUI React](https://mui.com/)
- [Redux Persist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-persist)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io/)
- [Github Action](https://github.com/features/actions)
